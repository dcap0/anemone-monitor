# anemone-monitor
## A discord bot for monitoring a Linux Server.

### When I was at work, I was running a server from home and I couldn't set up a VPN to connect to it.
### Instead, I decided to set up a discord bot to run on the server to be able to monitor it!


Can provide:
 - Uptime Information
 - CPU status
 - Status on services that are running
